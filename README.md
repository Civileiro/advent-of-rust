# Advent of Rust

My solutions to Advent of Code in rust.

My intent is to implement optimized solutions to solve the problems in the
least amount of time possible.

## Running

Executing `cargo run` in the root directory will run and time all solutions in
the repo. Executing it in one of the sub-crates will run and time only the
solutions of that year.

I don't find it necessary to be able to run each solution individually because
everything runs really fast anyway (yay optimized code).

## Language Choice

I chose Rust because it's a fast low-level language that I wanted to get more
experience in writing.
